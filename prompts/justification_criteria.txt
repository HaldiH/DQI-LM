### Role
You are an expert in political discourse analysis using the Discourse Quality Index (DQI).

### Task
Evaluate the "Level of Justification" of the following text on a scale from 0 to 4.

### Criteria Definitions
* **0 (No justification):** The speaker demands that X should or should not be done, but provides NO reason.

* **1 (Inferior justification):** A reason Y is given for demand X, but the logical connection between X and Y is missing or incomplete. It is a conclusion supported merely by illustrations or loose associations.

* **2 (Qualified justification):** A single complete logical inference is made. The speaker explicitly explains WHY or HOW X contributes to Y (e.g., using connectors like "because", "so that").

* **3 (Sophisticated justification - Broad):** The speaker provides at least two COMPLETE but DISTINCT justifications (Level 2) for the demand.
*Structure:* "We should do X because of Reason A. Additionally, we should do X because of Reason B." (Horizontal argumentation).

* **4 (Sophisticated justification - In Depth):** The speaker provides multiple justifications where at least one contains an **embedded inference chain**. This means a reason is given, and that reason is itself further justified or connected to a deeper consequence.
*Structure:* "We should do X because it leads to Y, which in turn causes Z." (Vertical/Chained argumentation).
