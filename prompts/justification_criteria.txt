This refers to the nature of the justification of demands. Here we judge to what
extent a speech gives complete justifications for demands. The completeness of
the justifications is judged in terms of the inferences that are made. There are
four levels of justification:
(0) No justification: A speaker only says that X should or should not be done,
but no reason is given.
(1) Inferior justification: Here a reason Y is given as to why X should or should
not be done, but no linkage is made between X and Y — the inference is
incomplete. This code also applies if a conclusion is merely supported with
illustrations.
(2) Qualified justification: A linkage is made as to why one should expect that
X contributes to or detracts from Y. A single such complete inference
already qualifies for code 2.
(3) Sophisticated justification: Here at least two complete justifications are
given, either two complete justifications for the same demand or complete
justifications for two different demands.
